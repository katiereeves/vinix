## Contributing to the Vinix kernel and OS

#### **Found a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead email me personaly at [my email](katie.sb.reeves@gmail.com).

* **Before posting check to see if the bug was already reported!**
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, you may open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic "patch"?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will NOT not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [vinix mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vinix/7uCOft04tUk) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about Vinix's source at our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vinix/7uCOft04tUk).

### **End notes**
Vinix is at the moment a personal project, but I would love others to contribute :heart:
